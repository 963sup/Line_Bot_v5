# Identity & Access

Read this file for authorization-policy ownership. Detailed permission catalog and mutation semantics: [permissions reference](../reference/security/permissions.md).

## Responsibility

Identity & Access owns scoped RoleAssignment, feature Permission definitions/grants/administration, and policy decisions that are not owned by a business lifecycle.

It does not own User identity proof/lifecycle, OrganizationMembership, Employment, Team membership, or the business state being protected.

## Invariants

- Authentication proof ≠ qualification ≠ membership/employment ≠ permission/role.
- Read, write, administer and appoint-admin capabilities are distinct.
- Permission/scope decisions use current authority; revoked or stale state cannot be recovered from UI/cache/old receipt.
- Client role/scope/ID is request input only; protected operations re-evaluate server-side.
- RLS/grants are defense in depth, not the policy owner.

Runtime package: `packages/identity-access`.
